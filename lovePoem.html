  <h1>A Love Poem for You</h1>
  <p>
    In the symphony of life, you are my sweetest note,<br>
    With every beat of my heart, your love it wrote.<br>
    Your laughter, a melody, in my soul it floats,<br>
    A love so pure, in every word it quotes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the canvas of time, our story is drawn,<br>
    Each chapter with you, a new dawn.<br>
    Your eyes, the stars, in my night sky,<br>
    Guiding me with love as time goes by.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together we dance in the moonlight's glow,<br>
    In your arms, my love continues to grow.<br>
    A love poem written in the language of our hearts,<br>
    Forever and always, we'll never be apart.
  </p>
  <p>
    So here's my love, penned in this rhyme,<br>
    A promise to cherish you, throughout all time.<br>
    You are my muse, my heart's delight,<br>
    My love for you, an eternal light.
  </p>
  <p>
    Forever yours,<br>
   daddy~
